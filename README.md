#  Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis 
A hands-on project to capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark, focusing on identifying common internet protocols.

##  Project Overview
The objective of this task was to develop practical skills in packet analysis. Using Wireshark, I captured live traffic generated by common activities like browsing a website and pinging a server. The goal was to demystify network communication by observing how different protocols like DNS, ICMP, and HTTP work together to deliver a service. This exercise is fundamental to network troubleshooting and security analysis.

##  Key Activities Performed
* **Live Packet Capture:** Successfully captured live network data from my active interface using Wireshark and its Npcap driver.
* **Traffic Generation:** Intentionally generated specific types of traffic (DNS, ICMP, HTTP) to ensure a varied and analyzable dataset.
* **Display Filtering:** Used Wireshark's powerful display filters to isolate and inspect individual protocol streams within the captured data.
* **Protocol Identification:** Analyzed the filtered packets to identify the function and flow of three core Internet protocols.

##  Key Concepts & Learnings
* **The TCP/IP Suite in Action:** This project provided a clear, real-world view of how different protocols in the TCP/IP suite collaborate. For example, DNS is used first to get an IP address before ICMP or HTTP can communicate with the server.
* **Packet Structure:** I learned that all network communication is broken down into small units called packets, each with its own source, destination, and protocol-specific information.
* **Network Troubleshooting:** I now understand how Wireshark can be used to diagnose problems, such as verifying if a DNS request is being sent or if a web server is responding correctly.
* **The Power of Filtering:** With thousands of packets captured in a minute, I learned that using display filters is the most essential skill for finding the specific conversation you need to analyze.
